            Hello, I‚Äôm Greg from Perth, Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø I‚Äôve been programming for over a decade and have
            5+ years of experience as a software engineer. I started as a backend engineer doing
            everything AWS and Java but found myself loving project with real customer
            impact which led me to more full-stack work.<br/><br/>

            I have now worked on Prime Video‚Äôs livingroom app, implemented developer tools
            for Prime Video Builder Tool, launched features and maintained multiple AWS services,
            and lead projects for customer facing features which spanned across multiple AWS
            services. During that time I have worked across many tech stacks and environments
            and learned many programming languages on the way.<br/><br/>

            I have a real passion to learn new things and I‚Äôm not afraid to try new things. As
            a full-stack engineer I have experience working closely with senior product
            managers, senior UX designers, principal engineers and managers.<br/><br/>

            I am currently taking a break from work with my wife to travel around Europe
            in our van, Judi! üöê<br/><br/>
