                            Hello, I‚Äôm Greg from Perth, Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø I‚Äôve been programming for over a decade and have
                            5+ years of experience as a software engineer. I started as a backend engineer doing
                            everything AWS and Java but found myself loving project with real customer
                            impact which led me to more full-stack work.<br /><br />

                            I have now worked on Prime Video‚Äôs livingroom app, implemented developer tools
                            for Prime Video Builder Tool, launched features and maintained multiple AWS services,
                            and led projects for customer-facing features which spanned across multiple AWS
                            services. During that time I have worked across many tech stacks and environments
                            and learned many programming languages on the way.<br /><br />

                            I have a real passion for learning new things and I‚Äôm not afraid to try anything new. As
                            a full-stack engineer I have experience working closely with senior product
                            managers, senior UX designers, principal engineers and managers.<br /><br />

                            I have recently taken time off work to travel with my wife around Europe in our
                            van, Judi! üöê I am now actively looking for a full-stack software engineering role
                            with real customer impact. <br /><br />
